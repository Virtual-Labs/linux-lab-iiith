		Welcom to File Content Experiment, the third experiment 
		of systems and software lab. This experiment consists of
        	description of various unix command programs which helps
		in viewing content of text files in different dimesnsion
		according to requirement.
	</p>

		This platform of this experiment is command line 
		interface which give terminal of linux machine.
		Linux terminal will help user to perform basic linux 
		commands for the tasks mentioned in simulation section.
	</p>
	<p>
		Theory section will give brief descriptions of 
		commands with examples which helps practicing to 
		view content of a text file in different ways 
		using linux commands.
