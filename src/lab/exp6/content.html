	      Before going to the actual commands to know the system
	      information, lets know the terminologies used in this
	      experiment.</p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  <h4>Process:</h4> 
		  <p>
		    A process is a running instance of a program.
		    Sometimes it can be referred as a task.
		  </p>
		  <p> A <b>program</b> is a set of instructions that are
		    meant to perform a specific task.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h4>Memory units:</h4>
		  <p>1 Kilo Byte (KB) = 1024 Bytes </p>
		  <p>1 Mega Byte (MB) = 1024 Kilo Bytes </p>
		  <p>1 Giga Byte (GB) = 1024 Mega Bytes </p>
		  <p>1 Tera Byte (TB) = 1024 Giga Bytes </p>
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      <br/><br/>
	    <p>
	      The following are the list of Linux commands which are
	      used to get the system information. The commands are
	      divided according to their area of usage.
	    </p>
	    <u><h2>Main Memory Usage</h2></u>
	    <ol>
	      <h3>
		<li>free
	      </h3> 
	      <p>
		The 'free' command prints the total amount of free and
		used RAM (and swap) memory in the system, as well as
		the buffers used by the kernel.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
user@linux:~$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1918584    1549980     368604          0     180488     704172
-/+ buffers/cache:     665320    1253264
Swap:      9577468          0    9577468
	      </pre>
	      <p>
		"-h" option is used to get the numbers in human readable
		format, scaled to shortest three digit unit and
		display the units of print out. The units are
		mentioned above.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
user@linux:~$ free -h
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          1.8G       1.5G       361M         0B       176M       687M
-/+ buffers/cache:       648M       1.2G
Swap:         9.1G         0B       9.1G
	      </pre>	

	      <p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    The "total" column of "Mem:" row indicates the
		    memory size of the RAM. Here we can see that the
		    RAM is of 1.8GB, of which 1.5GB is currently in
		    use and 361MB is free. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Since the memory used for buffers and cache can
		    easily be reclaimed for use by applications, the
		    second row (-/+ buffers/cache) provides an
		    indication of the memory actually used by
		    applications (the "used" column) or available to
		    applications (the "free" column). Here we can see
		    that the actual RAM used by the applications is
		    648MB and the available RAM is 1.2GB. That means,
		    the actual load is of 648MB only.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    You can <b>ignore</b> the other options for now. If you
		    want more information, run the manual "man free"
		    in shell.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
              </li>
	    </ol>
<br/><br/>
	    <u><h2>Process related commands</h2></u>
	    <ol>
	      <h3>
		<li>ps
	      </h3>
	      <p>The ps (process status) command is used to provide
	      information about the currently running processes,
	      including their process identification numbers (PIDs).
	      Every process is assigned a unique PID by the system.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
user@linux:~$ ps
 PID TTY          TIME CMD
5957 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
6147 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
	      </pre>
	      
	      <p>
		When "ps" is used without any options, it gives an
		output of running processes in the current shell, with
		four items of information. At least two processes will
		be displayed because those must be currently running
		on that shell: the shell and ps.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		A common and convenient way of using <b>ps</b> to
		obtain much more complete information about the
		processes currently on the system is to use the "aux"
		option, where:
		<ul>
		  <li><h4>a</h4> option is to list the processes of
		  all users on the system rather than just those of
		  the current user with the exception of processes not
		  associated with a terminal.</li>
		  <li><h4>u</h4> option tells ps to provide detailed
		  information about each process. This option doesn't
		  give the processes which do not have a controlling
		  terminal/shell.</li>
		  <li><h4>x</h4> option adds to the list processes
		  that have no controlling terminal, such as daemons,
		  which are programs that are launched during
		  booting.</li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">

	      <p>
		As the list of processes can be quite long and occupy
		more than a single screen, the output of "ps aux" can
		be piped (i.e., transferred) to the "less" command,
		which lets it be viewed one screenful at a time.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
user@linux:~$ ps aux |less
	      </pre>
	      
	      <p> We can find more output columns when we use
	      "aux". Some of the output columns are explained
	      below. You can <b>ignore</b> the remaining for now.
		<ul>
		  <li><h4>USER</h4>User who is owning/running the
		    process</li>
		  <li><h4>%CPU</h4>It is the CPU time used divided by
		    the time the process has been running. It means,
		    the percentage of CPU resource it is using.</li>
		  <li><h4>%MEM</h4>Percentage of RAM memory it is
		    using.</li>
		  <li><h4>START</h4>starting time or date of the
		    process</li>
		  <li><h4>TIME</h4>cumulative CPU time the process is
		    using.</li>
		  <li><h4>COMMAND</h4>command with all its
		    arguments. </li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
              </li>
              <br/><br/>
              <h3>
		<li>top
	      </h3>
              <p>
		The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a
		running system.  It can display system summary
		information as well as a list of processes or threads
		currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
	      </p>
              <p>
		The program provides a limited interactive interface
		for process manipulation as well as a much more
		extensive interface for personal configuration --
		encompassing every aspect of its operation.

	       prints the LSB version. When used with the '-a' option,
	       'lsb_release' prints all the information. Use '-h'
	       option to look at the complete set of options and their
	       actions.</p>
