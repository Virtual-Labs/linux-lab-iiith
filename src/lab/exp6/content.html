	      The following are the list of Linux commands which are
	      used to get the system information. The commands are
	      divided according to their area of usage.
	    </p>
	    <u><h2>Main Memory Usage</h2></u>
	    <ol>
	      <h3>
		<li>free
	      </h3> 
	      <p>
		The 'free' command prints the total amount of free and
		used physical and swap memory in the system, as well
		as the buffers used by the kernel. 
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
		vlabs@vlabs-laptop:~$ free
		             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
		Mem:       1918584    1818296     100288          0      74292    1092860
		-/+ buffers/cache:     651144    1267440
		Swap:      9577468       1108    9576360
	      </pre>
	      <p>
		-m option is used to get the numbers in
		"megabytes(MB)"
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
		vlabs@vlabs-laptop:~$ free -m
		             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
		Mem:          1873       1603        269          0         80        776
		-/+ buffers/cache:        747       1126
		Swap:         9352          1       9351
	      </pre>	

	      <p>
		The columns of the output of "free" command explained
		below.
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    The "total" column indicates the memory size of
		    Physical RAM (Mem) or swap area (Swap). Here we can
		    see that the Physical RAM is of 1873MB (~1.8GB), of
		    which 1603MB (~1.6GB) is currently in use.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    The "shared" column lists the amount of physical
		    memory shared between multiple processes.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    The "buffers" column shows the amount of memory
		    being used by the kernel buffer cache. The buffer
		    cache is used to speed up disk operations, by
		    allowing disk reads and writes to be serviced
		    directly from memory. The buffer cache size will
		    increase or decrease as memory usage on the system
		    changes.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    The "cached" column indicates how many memory
		    pages the kernel has cached for faster access
		    later.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Since the memory used for buffers and cache can
		    easily be reclaimed for use by applications, the
		    second row (-/+ buffers/cache) provides an
		    indication of the memory actually used by
		    applications (the "used" column) or available to
		    applications (the "free" column). The sum of the
		    memory used by buffers and cache reported in the
		    first row is subtracted from the total used memory
		    and added to the total free memory to give the two
		    figures on the second line.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
              </li>
	    </ol>
	    <u><h2>Process related commands</h2></u>
	    <ol>
	      <h3>
		<li>ps
	      </h3>
	      <p>The ps (i.e., process status) command is used to
	      provide information about the currently running
	      processes, including their process identification
	      numbers (PIDs). A process, also referred to as a task,
	      is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a
	      program. Every process is assigned a unique PID by the
	      system.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
		vlabs@vlabs-laptop:~$ ps
		 PID TTY          TIME CMD
		5957 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
		6147 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
	      </pre>
	      
	      <p>
		When "ps" is used without any options, it give an output
		with four items of information for at least two
		processes currently on that shell: the shell and ps.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In the above output, the four columns are PID, TTY,
		TIME and CMD where
		<ul>
		  <li><h4>PID</h4> stands for Process Identification
		  number</li>
		  <li><h4>TTY</h4> stands for Terminal Type, is the
		  name of the console or terminal that the user logged
		  into. Here, it is shell number. </li>
		  <li><h4>TIME</h4> is the amount of CPU time in
		  minutes and seconds that the process has been
		  running.</li>
		  <li><h4>CMD</h4> is the name of the command that
		  launched the process.</li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		A common and convenient way of using ps to obtain much
		more complete information about the processes
		currently on the system is to use the "aux" option,
		where:
		<ul>
		  <li><h4>a</h4> option is to list the processes of
		  all users on the system rather than just those of
		  the current user with the exception of processes not
		  associated with a terminal.</li>
		  <li><h4>u</h4> option tells ps to provide detailed
		  information about each process. This option doesn't
		  give the processes which do not have a controlling
		  terminal/shell.</li>
		  <li><h4>x</h4> option adds to the list processes
		  that have no controlling terminal, such as daemons,
		  which are programs that are launched during
		  booting.</li>
		</ul>

	      <p>
		As the list of processes can be quite long and occupy
		more than a single screen, the output of "ps aux" can
		be piped (i.e., transferred) to the "less" command,
		which lets it be viewed one screenful at a time.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
		vlabs@vlabs-laptop:~$ ps aux |less
	      </pre>
	      
	      <p> We can find more output columns when we use
	      "aux". The output columns are explained below:
				<ul>
		  <li><h4>USER</h4>User owning the process</li>
		  <li><h4>PID</h4>Process ID of the process</li>
		  <li><h4>%CPU</h4>It is the CPU time used divided by
		  the time the process has been running.</li>
		  <li><h4>%MEM</h4>Ratio of the process's resident set
		  size to the physical memory on the machine.</li>
		  <li><h4>VSZ</h4>virtual memory usage of entire
		  process.</li>
		  <li><h4>RSS</h4>resident set size, the non-swapped
		  physical memory that a task has used</li>
		  <li><h4>TTY</h4>controlling tty (terminal)</li>
		  <li><h4>STAT</h4>multi-character process state.</li>
		  <li><h4>START</h4>starting time or date of the
		  process</li>
		  <li><h4>TIME</h4>cumulative CPU time</li>
		  <li><h4>COMMAND</h4>command with all its
		  arguments</li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <p><h3>Other Options</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li><h4>-C</h4>Select by command name.  This selects
		  the processes whose executable name is given in
		  cmdlist</li>
		  <li><h4>-f</h4>Do full-format listing. This option
		    can be combined with many other UNIX-style options
		    to add additional columns. It also causes the
		    command arguments to be printed. When used with
		    -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread
		    ID) columns will be added.  See the c option, the
		    format keyword args, and the format keyword
		    comm.</li>
		  <li><h4>-F</h4>Extra full format. See the -f
		    option, which -F implies.</li>
		</ul>
              </li>
              <br/><br/>
              <h3>
		<li>top
	      </h3>
              <p>
		The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a
		running system.  It can display system summary
		information as well as a list of processes or threads
		currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  The
		types of system summary information shown and the
		types, order and size of information displayed for
		processes are all user configurable and that
		configuration can be made persistent across restarts.
	      </p>
              <p>
		The program provides a limited interactive interface
		for process manipulation as well as a much more
		extensive interface for personal configuration --
		encompassing every aspect of its operation.  And while
		top is referred to throughout this document, you are
		free to name the program anything you wish.  That new
		name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on
		top's display and used when reading and writing a
		configuration file.
