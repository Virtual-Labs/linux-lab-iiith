	  Welcome to the permissions experiment!  This
	  experiment is intended to provide an understanding
	  of Linux file permissions.  This experiment
	  involves explanation of various command(s) which
	  can be used to modify file permissions in Linux
	  Operating System.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The experimental platform for this experiment is a
	  command line interface which mimics the terminal
	  of a Linux machine.  This interface is intended to

	    Note that throughout this experiment word 'file'
	    has been used to indicate all types of files
	    including regular files and directories. Linux
	    also has other types of files, description of
	    which is outside the scope of this lab. If a
	    particular statement is true only for regular
	    file or directory but not for both then this
	    would be mentioned specifically.
	  </p>


	<h3>Ownership: User owner, Group owner and
	Others</h3>
	<h3>User owner</h3>
	<p>
	  The understanding of Linux file permissions
	  requires an understanding of various types of file
	  ownership.  In Linux all files have a user owner
	  and a group owner.  The user who creates a
	  particular file becomes its owner automatically.
	  Later another user can be made the owner of a file
	  by changing file's ownership.  Thus, by modifying
	  ownership any file can be owned by any Linux user.
	</p>

	<h3>Groups</h3>
	<p>
	  Multiple users can be grouped together in a
	  user-group.  There is no limit on the number of
	  users that can be part of a group.  It is even
	  possible to have a Linux group with zero
	  users. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  To grant access to a file to more than one user
	  groups are necessary.  To allow more than one user
	  to access to a file, all the required users are
	  made part of a same user-group.  Then the group
	  owner of the file is changed to the newly created
	  group.  This allows all the members belonging to
	  the group which owns the file to access the file
	  while restricting others from doing so.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Note that it is possible for a user to belong to
	  many different groups.  A user always belongs to
	  at least one special group called 'primary group'.
	  Apart for this primary group, the user can also
	  belong to any number of additional groups, called
	  secondary groups.
	</p>

	<h3>Example 1</h3>
	<p>
	  The following example can be used to understand
	  afore mentioned points properly.  Consider a Linux
	  system with files: english.txt, maths.txt,
	  physics.txt, marks.txt and students.txt as shown
	  in Figure 1.
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/all_files.svg" width="743px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  1: </span> Files used in Example 1.
	</p>


	<p>
	  Also assume that the system under consideration
	  has following teachers as users: english_teacher,
	  maths_teacher, physics_teacher and principal as
	  shown it Figure 2.  The system also has student
	  users such as student_a, student_b and student_c
	  as shown in Figure 3.
	</p>

-	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/all_teachers.svg" width="720px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  2: </span> Teacher users for Example 1.
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/all_students.svg" style="width:418px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  3: </span> Student users for Example 1.
	</p>

	<h3>Example 1 - Requirement 1</h3>
	<p>
	  As part of this example let us consider a
	  requirement where subject teachers' need access to
	  files of their subjects.  Thus english_teacher
	  needs access to english.txt, maths_teacher needs
	  access to maths.txt and physics_teacher needs
	  access to physics.txt.  This requirement is shown
	  with the help of Figure 4 below.
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/teacher_subject.svg"
	  style="width:583px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  4: </span> Teachers needs access to files of their
	  subject.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This requirement is easy to satisfy by making
	  respective teachers the user owners of the files
	  of their subjects.  Thus, if user owners for the
	  files are set as shown in Table 1 below, then the
	  above mentioned requirement would get satisfied.
	</p>

	<div style="text-align:center">
	  <table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
	    <caption>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold">Table 1:</span>
	      Ownership of subject files
	    </caption>
	    <thead>
	      <tr>
		<th>File name</th>
		<th>User owner</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
		<td>english.txt</td>
		<td>english_teacher</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>maths.txt</td>
		<td>maths_teacher</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>physics.txt</td>
		<td>physics_teacher</td>
	      </tr>
	    </tbody>
	  </table>
	</div>


	<h3>Example 1: Requirement 2</h3>
        <p>
	  Another requirement can be that all teachers need
	  access to marks.txt file.  This requirement can be
	  satisfied by keeping all teachers in a group, say
	  teachers, and then by making group owner of file
	  marks.txt to be group 'teacher'.  This particular
	  requirement and its solution are explained with
	  the help of Figures 5, 6 and Table 2.
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/teacher_marks.svg"
	  style="width:583px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  5: </span> All teachers need to access marks.txt
	  file 
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center">
	  <img src="media/teacher_group.svg"
	  style="width:583px"/><br/>
	  <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
	  6: </span> All teachers are made part of teacher group 
	</p>


	<div style="text-align:center">
	  <table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
	    <caption>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold">Table 2:</span>
	      Group owner for marks.txt file
	    </caption>
	    <thead>
	      <tr>
		<th>File name</th>
		<th>Group owner</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
		<td>marks.txt</td>
		<td>teacher group</td>
	      </tr>
	    </tbody>
	  </table>
	</div>

	<p>
	  Thus basic access requirements where only one user
	  needs access to a file or where a set of users
	  need access to a file, can be satisfied by using
	  users and groups, and by changing user owner and
	  group owner of the file as per the requirement. 
	</p>
	


	<h3>Access types or modes</h3>
	<p>
	  Just specifying which user and which group should
	  have access to particular file may not be enough.
	  It may also be required to specify what type of
	  access (read, write or execute) should a
	  particular user have on a given file. 
	</p>

	<h3>Regular file permissions</h3>
	<p>
	  Three different types of permissions can be
	  applied to regular files: read, write and execute
	  which are described below.
	</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>read</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Read permissions on a regular file (not a
	      directory) indicate that particular user or
	      members of the group are allowed to read the
	      file.  For example, if a user or a group has
	      read permissions on a text file then the user
	      or members of the group would be allowed to
	      see the contents of the text file using cat
	      command.  Read permissions are denoted by
	      alphabet 'r' and number '4' at various
	      occasions, hence Linux users should be
	      comfortable with using 'r' or '4' for
	      specifying read permissions as and when
	      required.
	    </p>
	  </dd>

	  <dt>write</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Write permissions on a regular file (not a
	      directory) indicate that particular user or
	      members of the group are allowed to write to
	      the file.  For example, if a user or a group
	      has write permissions on a text file then the
	      user or members of the group would be able to
	      modify the contents of the text file using vim
	      text editor.  Write permissions are denoted by
	      alphabet 'w' and number '2'.
	    </p>
	  </dd>


	  <dt>execute</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Execute permissions on a regular file (not a
	      directory) indicate that particular user or
	      members of the group are allowed to execute
	      (run) the file as a program.  Note that
	      execute permission may not make any sense on a
	      generic text file as execution of normal
	      language text is not defined. Thus, execute
	      permissions make sense only for scripts and
	      programs and not for every file.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      But Linux will not object if execute
	      permissions are assigned to some file which is
	      not a program such as an image file, and thus
	      cannot be executed.  Error message or
	      unexpected side-effects would be obtained
	      while attempting to run the image file but not
	      while assigning execute permissions to it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Thorough understanding of execute permissions
	      is not expected from beginner users right
	      away.  Hence do not worry if meaning of
	      execute permissions is not very clear.  It
	      requires some time to really understand what
	      execute permissions really mean. Execute
	      permissions are denoted by alphabet 'x' or
	      number '1' where ever required.
	    </p>
	  </dd>

	</dl>


	<p>
	  Note that as part of this experiment words
	  'folder' and 'directory' are used interchangeably
	  and they both mean the same thing.
	</p>


	<h3>Directory or folder permissions</h3>

	<p>
	  Similar to a regular file three different types of
	  permissions can be applied to a folder or
	  directory: read, write and execute.  But
	  the interpretation or significance of these
	  permissions for a directory is quite different
	  from that of a regular file. The explanation of
	  these different types of permissions for a folder
	  is described below:
	</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>read</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Read permissions on a directory (not a regular
	      file) indicate that particular user or members
	      of the group are allowed to list the contents
	      of the directory (read the directory).  For
	      example, if a user or a group has read
	      permissions on a directory then the user or
	      members of the group would be allowed to see
	      the contents of the directory using ls
	      command.  Same as in case of regular files,
	      read permissions for directories also are
	      denoted by alphabet 'r' or number '4'.
	    </p>
	  </dd>

	  <dt>write</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Write permissions on a directory (not a
	      regular file) indicate that particular user or
	      members of the group are allowed to create new
	      files inside the given directory.  For
	      example, if a user or a group has write
	      permissions on a directory then the user or
	      members of the group would be able to create
	      new files inside the directory using mkdir or
	      touch commands.  Moreover write permissions on
	      a directory also allow users to rename or
	      delete the files present inside the directory
	      using rmdir or rm command.  
	    </p>
	  </dd>


	  <dt>execute</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>
	      Execute permissions on a directory (not a
	      regular file) indicate that particular user or
	      members of the group are allowed to change
	      directory (cd) to given folder and also access
	      files inside the given folder.  If a user does
	      not has execute permissions on a folder, then
	      the user cannot access any file present inside
	      the folder.
	    </p>
	  </dd>

	</dl>
