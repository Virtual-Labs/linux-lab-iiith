	Welcome to rsync, the ninth experiment of the Systems and
	Software lab.  This experiment consists of teaching a smart
	technique to synchronize folders across different paths and
	even machines.
	</p>

<p> The experimental platform for this experiment is a command line
 interface which mimics the terminal of a Linux machine. The command
 line interface supports a few basic commands to enable the user to
 learn Rsync basics. There are a series of tasks which need to be performed in each experiment.

	</p><p> Proceed to the theory section to get an overview of
	the commands. Then move to the experiment section to get some
	hands-on experience and finish the experiment tasks. After you
	are done with the experiment, go to the quiz section to test
	your understanding.

	<p><font size="4">What is rsync?</font></p>
	<p>rsync is a utility tool that is used to synchronize files
and folders across different directories in the same computer, or even
across different computers connected directly or via a network.

The main advantage which rsync has over other synchronization tools is
that is only transfers parts of a file/folder which have been changed,
unlike copying each file over and again, irrespective of that fact
whether that file has been changed or not.
</p>


<font size="4">1. Why is rsync needed?</font>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we assume that we have a file in our /home
directory called *foo*, which is normally known as a *working copy*
(as we will always work on it), and we maintain a backup of the file
known as a *mirror*, in a folder */media/bar*, a mounted partition in
our computer.  This mounted partition can also exist on a separate
computer, about which we will discuss in some time.</p>

<p>A typical software project consists of several files, many of which
remain unchanged most of the time. If we maintain a backup of such a
project in a separate mounted partition every time we make a change ,
we end up copying many files which have not been altered since the
last backup. An obvious alternate would be to back up data on a hourly
or daily basis, but that would mean that if there is a system failure,
there is a very high probability that a certain user would lose upto a
day's work.</p>

<p>Thus, the obvious choice to make smart and faster backups is to use an
utility that would calculate whether a certain directory/file has any
changes compared to the backup directory. If there are any changes,
only those changes should be sent to the backup directory, and thus
save CPU cycles, and if the backup exists on a separate computer,
valuable network bandwidth.</p>

<p>rysnc does exactly that. It checks for files whose files sizes or
modification times have changed w.r.t. backups using a "quick-check"
al gorithm, and then, sends the differences across to the destination,
where the files/folders are appropriately altered.
</p>

<p><font size="4">How is rsync used?</font></p>
A typical use of rsync looks like:

rsync <options> <source> <destination>
<br />

<u>Create a file/folder which has to be rsynced</u>

<pre class="code">$ touch foo</pre> <br />

<u>Sync the file to the destination</u>

<pre class="code">$ rsync foo /media/bar</pre><br />

<u>Alter the contents of foo</u>

<pre class="code">$ echo "hello world">foo</pre><br />

<u>Rsync the file between two folders</u>

<pre class="code">$ rsync  foo /media/bar</pre><br />

<u>Alter the contents of foo again</u>

<pre class="code">$ echo "Welcome!">foo</pre><br />

<u>Rsync again between two folders</u>

<pre class="code">$ rsync foo /media/bar</pre> <br/>



<p>Any changes to made to foo and then rsynced to bar will effect in
rsync calculating the difference between two files and then
transmitting the difference, every time you run rsync. The same can be
applied to folders as well. </p>

<u>Create a folder and create a file inside it</u> <br />
<pre class="code">$ mkdir qux</pre><br />
<pre class="code">$ touch foo </pre><br /><br />

<u>Rsync qux to the backup directory /media/baz</u>

<pre class="code">$ rsync qux /media/baz</pre><br /><br />

<u>Create a couple of more files inside qux</pre></u>
<pre class="code"> $ echo "welcome!">foo</pre><br />
<pre class="code"> $ echo "hello world">bar</pre><br /> <br />

<u>Rsync qux to the backup directory /media/baz</u><br /><br />

<pre class="code">$ rsync -r qux /media/baz</pre><br />

<p>The option r means recursively synchronizing a folder. This is
particularly useful as rsync will go inside every sub-folder present
inside the parent directory.</p>

Now that we have learned how to tweak BASH look and environment variables, we
have a set of exercises for you.

The shell above supports few basic shell commands. Play along to get
some hands-on experience of the interface.

When you are ready to perform the exercise, which is a set of 5 tasks,
enter the command "start".
