<h3>grep Command</h3>

<code>grep</code> is an extremely powerful search
utility.  <code>grep</code> searches the specified files for the lines
containing a match to the given pattern specified through a regular
expression.  By default, for each line that matches or contains a match to the
given pattern, it prints that line as output. 

<br />
<br />

The syntax for using grep command is:
<br />
<code>grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]</code>
<br />
<code>grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]</code>  
<br />
where OPTIONS are the various options available with the grep command,
PATTERN is the regular expression pattern to search for, FILE is the
file containing the text which is matched against the pattern. If no
file name is given then grep reads from the standard input. 

<br /> <br />
<b>The regular expression pattern should always be enclosed within
single-quotes.</b> 

<br /> 
<br />

<b>Regular Expressions</b>
<br />

Regular expressions (regex) are used to specify a pattern which matches
a sequence of characters given as input.  The characters used for
constructing regular expressions are as follows:
<ul>
<li>[] - anything inside the square brackets would be matched once and only once</li>
<li>Alphabet Characters - both upper and lower cases - denoted as [a-z] and [A-Z]</li>
<li>Digits denoted as [0-9]</li>
<li>? meta character denotes a character may occur 0 or 1 times</li>
<li>* meta character denotes a character may occur 0 or more times</li>
<li>+ meta character denotes a character may occur 1 or more than 1 time</li>
</ul>

<br />

For example, the strings <code>abbde, abde, abbbbde</code> can be
denoted using a regular expression <code>a[b]+de</code>. The '+' meta
character signifies that 'b' can be repeated more than 1 time.
Similarly, a string made of alphabets and digits such as <code>abc09af,
abbbb987, a9876, abbb5</code> can be written using the regular expression
<code>[a-z]+[0-9]+[a-z]*</code> where first character should be an
alphabet and there may be more of alphabets, one numeric character
should follow and more digits can occur there after and more alphabets
may or may not occur in the string.

<br />
<br />

Thus, while using the <code>grep</code> command, regular expressions are
very useful in searching for patterns of strings in the file. To
demonstrate how <code>grep</code> functions, we take a sample text file
and run the commands on it. The text file is as such:

<pre class="code">
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23
</pre>

The rules of constructing regular expressions have been explained as follows:

<br />

<ol>

<li>

Any literal character [a-z] is a pattern that matches itself. Thus, each
of the literal character is a regular expression in itself.

<pre class="code">
$ grep 'a' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23
</pre>

The command matches 'a' in every line of the file.  <b>Please note that
when the command is the terminal / shell, the pattern given in the
command is highlighted in the output.</b>  Thus, in the above example, every
occurrence of 'a' is highlighted in red color on the terminal.

<br />
<br />

This rule doesn't apply to some meta-characters like '*','.' etc. which
have special meaning.  To match these meta-characters, backslash ('\')
should precede them to escape the characters.

</li>

<br />

<li>

Concatenation: Concatenation is achieved by writing regular expression
in sequence. For example, regular expressions 'a' and 'b' can be concatenated
to form a single regular expression 'ab'.

<br />
<br />

White space characters like space are also treated as regular
expressions.  The strings 'ab' and 'a b' are two different regular
expressions.

<pre class="code">
$ grep 'ab' example.txt 
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23

$ grep 'a b' example.txt
$
</pre>

All the lines with the pattern 'ab' are printed.  But, for the second
command, there is no output because there is not pattern 'a b' in the
file.

<br />
<br />

Parentheses '()' can be used to denote a regular expressions. 'abcd' is
concatenation of four regular expressions 'a', 'b', 'c'and 'd', but
'(ab)cd' is a concatenation of three regular expressions 'ab', 'c' and
'd'.

<br />
<br />

Note: In basic regex, parentheses lose their special meaning and instead
match '(' and ')'. With basic regex parentheses should be used with
backslash.

<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '(ab)cd' test</td>
<td>No output</td>
<td>Incorrect way. We are using basic regex.<br /> It tries to match <i>(</i> and <i>)</i> but none of the lines contain the parenthesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '\(ab\)cd' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh</td>
<td>Correct way</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep -E '(ab)cd' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh</td>
<td>Works because we are using extended regex.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />

C) Bracket ([]): A list of characters enclosed within '[' and ']' matches any single character in that list.
<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '[abcd]' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23
End of example file.</td>
<td>All of these lines contain at least one of the characters <i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i> or <i>d</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />
If the first character in the list of characters enclosed within '[' and ']' is '^' then this pattern matches any character excluded from this list.

<br />
<br />
We can use a dash (-) to specify a range of characters. [a-d] is equivalent to writing [abcd] and [1-6] is equivalent to writing [123456]. [A-Za-z0-9] matches both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers.
<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '[0-9]' test</td>
<td>123456
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23
</td>
<td>Matches only the lines containg numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '[^a-z]' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
123456
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23
End of example file.</td>
<td>Matches everything except lowercase alphabets.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />

D) Matching the empty string: The following operators match the empty strings.<br />

<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>^</td>
<td>Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$</td>
<td>Matches the empty string at the end of a line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\<</td>
<td>Matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\></td>
<td>Matches the empty string at the end of a word.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />
<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '^ab' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23</td>
<td>Matches only the strings that start with ab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep 'ab$' test</td>
<td>abababab</td>
<td>Matches only the strings that end with ab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '\&lte' test</td>
<td>End of example file.</td>
<td>Matches only the words that begin with e.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep 'r\&gt' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.</td>
<td>Matches only the words that end with r.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />

E) Matching any character: The dot character (.) matches any single character.<br />

<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep 'a...3' test</td>
<td>ab*23</td>
<td>Matches any 5 character sequence that starts with <i>a</i> and ends with <i>3</i>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />

F) Repititions: There are several repitition operators which repeat the regular expressions preceding them.<br />
<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>*</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex zero or more times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex atmost once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex at least once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{n}</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex exactly n times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{n,}</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex n or more times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{n,m}</td>
<td>Matches the preceding regex at least n and at most n times.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<br />
<br />
Note: Except '*' all of the operators described above lose their special meaning when used with basic regex. Each of these operators have to be preceded by a backslash when used with basic regex or they have to be used extended regex.

<br />
<br />

<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep 'a*' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23
End of example file.
</td>
<td>Since all the lines contain <i>a</i> at least zero times, all the lines are printed as output. Appending <i>*</i> with <i>a</i> makes <i>a</i> optional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '^ab*' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23
</td>
<td>Matches all the lines which begin with <i>a</i> followed by zero or more <i>b</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '^\(ab\)\(ab\)*' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23
</td>
<td>Matches all the lines that begin with <i>ab</i> followed by zero or more <i>ab</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '^ab/?' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23
</td>
<td>Matches all the lines which begin with <i>a</i> followed by zero or one <i>b</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '^ab\+' test</td>
<td>abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23
</td>
<td>Matches all the lines which begin with <i>a</i> followed by at least one <i>b</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '.\{10\}' test
</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
ABCDefgh1234
End of example file.
</td>
<td>Matches a string exactly 10 characters long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '.\{6,\}' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
End of example file.
</td>
<td>Matches a string at least 6 characters long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '.\{6,10\}' test</td>
<td>Example file for grep.
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
End of example file.
</td>
<td>Matches a string at least 6 and at most 10 characters long.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />
<br />

G) The OR operator (|): The OR operator (|) can be used to join two regular expressions. The resulting pattern matches any string joined by the OR operator.<br />
Note: To use the OR operator with basic regex precede it with a backslash.<br />

<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">
<tr>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grep '\(^z+\)\|\(1234\)' test</td>
<td>123456
ABCDefgh1234
</td>
<td>Matches the lines which start with <i>z</i> or the string <i>1234</i>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Find Command</h3>

<br />
<br />

The <i>find</i> command is used to locate files on Linux system.  The
command searches for the set of directory specified in the argument for
the files.  The syntax for <code>find</code> is:

<br/>

<code>find [path] [option] [file name / expression]

<br />

where path is the directory where the file is to be located, file name
is the file to be located and expression are the regular expressions
which can be used for pattern matching.

<br />
<br />

Executing <code>find</code> in the terminal lists down all the files in
the current directory.  The command recursively searches all the files
and folders in the directory.

<pre class="code">
$ ls
abcd.org test/

$ find
.
./test
./test/dir
./test/dir/abc.org
./test/image2.jpg
./test/image1.jpg
./test/abc.tar
./test/abc.zip
./test/abd
./test/abc.org
./abcd.org
</pre>

<code>find</code> command provides many options for use.  In this
tutorial, only two commonly used options would be explained.  For
further information, please refer to the man page of <code>find</code>.
<br /> 
iname - takes an argument and recursively searches the specified
directory for the given file name or pattern 
<br /> 
delete - sometimes, the files no longer needed have to be deleted.
So, <code>find</code> command is used to locate them and delete is used
to delete the files

<pre class="code">
$ find -iname abc.org
./test/dir/abc.org
./test/abc.org
</pre>

To find the files in a specified directory,

<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname abc.org
test/test/dir/abc.org
test/test/abc.org
</pre>

To search for a file using a regular expression pattern, 

<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname 'ab*'
test/test/dir/abc.org
test/test/abc.tar
test/test/abc.zip
test/test/abd
test/test/abc.org
test/abcd.org
</pre>

To delete the specified file,

<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname abc.org -delete
</pre>

Please note that the delete Option should be used with caution.  It
should always be at the end of the command arguments.  If the delete
option is used before iname, all the files and folders would be deleted.
The command does not ask for permission or provide any warning,
whatsoever, before execution.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code> commands have been explained
in the theory section.  Now, the user should be able use these commands
to locate files in the directories easily.  For further information on
the commands, please refer to the Further Readings Section.
