This experiment introduces a console based text editor
called vim.  It is an improved version of the vi editor 
available on most UNIX systems (vim = vi improved).
</p>

<p>
Vim is a popular tool for writing computer programs as it
is very lightweight and has a lot of features such as syntax
highlighting, block operations and multi-level undo.  To
know more about vim, visit www.vim.org.
</p>

<p>
vimtutor is a very effective tutorial for learning vim.
After this experiment, learners are expected to go through
vimtutor and complete the lessons there.
</p>

<p>
The experimental platform for this experiment is a command line interface which mimics the terminal of a linux machine. The command line interface supports few basic set of commands to enable the user learn process control basics. There are a series of tasks which need to be performed in each experiment. </p>
</p>

<p>
Proceed to the theory section to get an overview of the commands and then move to the experiment section to get some hands-on experience and finish the experiment tasks. After you are done with the experiment go to the quiz section to test your understanding.

	  <h3>Starting and Exiting vim</h3>
	  <p>To start vim, type "vim filename" on the
 command prompt, e.g.</p>
	  <pre class="code">
$ vim helloworld.txt
	  </pre>
	  <p>
If helloworld.txt is an existing file, vim will open it.  If
it doesn't exist, vim will create the file.
	  </p>
	  <p>
To exit vim, go to the Escape mode (press the 'Esc' key),
press the : key (Shift + ;) and type one of the following
q (if you haven't made any change)
q! (if you have made changes, but don't want to save it)
wq (if you have made changes and want to save it)
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
:wq
	  </pre>
	  <h3>Modes in vim</h3>
	  <p>
INSERT Mode: This mode is where you will spend most of your
time in vim, as it allows you to write text in the current file.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Press 'i' in Escape Mode to enter Insert Mode.  When in
insert mode, you will see the word "INSERT" near the bottom
of the editor window, as below.
	  </p>
<pre class="code">
-- INSERT --
</pre>
	  <p>
Escape Mode or Normal Mode: This is the default mode that
you get after you start vim.  You can press 'i' to enter the Insert
mode and start typing.  Press 'Esc' key to go back to escape mode.
	  </p>
	  <p>
VISUAL Mode: This is a less-used mode.  It allows selecting
a section of text and applying vim commands on the
selection such as cut, copy.  Press 'Esc' key to go back to
escape mode.
	  </p>
	  <p>
When in visual mode, you will see the word "VISUAL" near the bottom
of the editor window, as below.
	  </p>
<pre class="code">
-- VISUAL --
</pre>
	  <p>
REPLACE Mode:  This is also a less-used mode.  It allows you
to replace current text in the file with anythin you type.
Press 'R' (Shift + r) to enter the REPLACE mode. Press 'Esc'
key to go back to escape mode.
	  </p>
	  <p>
When in replace mode, you will see the word "REPLACE" near the bottom
of the editor window, as below.
	  </p>
<pre class="code">
-- REPLACE --
</pre>
	  <h3>Cut, Copy, Paste</h3>
	  <p>
All these commands are run in Escape mode.  Press 'Esc' key
to go to Escape mode.  None of the commands you type here
will be visible.  You will see only their effects (i.e. text
being cut or copied and pasted).

When you cut more than 2 lines, e.g. 5dd, you get a message

	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
	    5 fewer lines
	  </pre>
	  <p>
Similarly, when you copy more than 2 lines, e.g. 10yy, you
get this message near the bottom of the vim screen:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
	    10 lines yanked
	  </pre>
	  <p>
If you run the paste command (type p in escape mode), you

You can undo subsequent changes using pressing 'u' again.
If there are no more changes to undo, you will get the below
message near the bottom of the vim window.
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
	    Already at oldest change
	  </pre>
	  <p>
Similarly, you can redo multiple times by repeatedly

	    The global substitution with confirmation (gc)

	    substution term.  You can respond with y if you
	    want to substitute that occurence, n if you
	    don't want to, a to substitute all subsequent
	    occurences, q to quit substituting.

	    This concludes the theory section of the text
	    editor experiment.  To learn more vim commands,
	    go through the built-in vim tutorial by running
	    the command "vimtutor"
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
	    $ vimtutor
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    vimtutor provides a reasonably detailed overview
	    of vim commands and helps you learn by doing.
	    We strongly encourage you to use vimtutor for
	    getting more familiar with vim text editor.
