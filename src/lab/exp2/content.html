		This experiment introduces a console-based text editor
		called vim.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		Vim is a popular editor for editing text files such as
		computer programs as it has a lot of features such as syntax
		highlighting, line numbering, block operations and
		multi-level undo.  To know more about vim, visit
		www.vim.org.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		To learn vim, most linux systems come with a tutorial called
		vimtutor.  Just type vimtutor at the shell prompt to start
		the tutorial.  After this experiment, learners are expected
		to  go through vimtutor and complete the lessons there.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		The experimental platform for this experiment is a command
		line interface which mimics the terminal of a linux
		machine. The command line interface supports few basic set
		of commands to enable the user learn process control
		basics. There are a series of tasks which need to be
		performed in each experiment. 
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		Proceed to the theory section to get an overview of the
		commands and then move to the experiment section to get some
		hands-on experience and finish the experiment tasks. After
		you are done with the experiment go to the quiz section to
		test your understanding.

	      <h3>Starting and Exiting vim</h3>
	      <p>To start vim, type "vim filename" on the
		command prompt, e.g.</p>
	      <pre class="code">$ vim helloworld.txt</pre>
	      <p>
		If helloworld.txt exists at the present
		working directory, vim will open it.  If
		it doesn't exist, vim will create the file
		once you save it using the save command below.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		To exit vim, go to the Normal mode (press the 'Esc' key),
		press the : key (Shift + ;) and type one of the following:
		<br />q (if you haven't made any change)
		<br />q! (if you have made changes, but don't want to save it)
		<br />wq (if you have made changes and want to save it)
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Please note that the vim commands are case-sensitive, hence 'w' has different meaning than 'W'.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">:wq</pre>
	      <h3>Modes in vim</h3>
	      <p>
		NORMAL Mode: This is the default mode that
		you get after you start vim.  This mode is
		not for typing text.  This is for running
		commands such as find, save, replace,
		etc.  You will learn these commands later in
		this experiment.  You can press 'i' to enter
		the Insert mode and start typing.  Press
		'Esc' key to go back to normal mode.
	      </p>
	      <br />
	      <p>
		INSERT Mode: This mode is where you will spend most of your
		time in vim, as it allows you to write text in the current file.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Press 'i' in Normal Mode to enter Insert Mode.  When in
		insert mode, you will see the word "INSERT" near the bottom
		of the editor window, as below.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">-- INSERT --</pre>
	      <p>
		VISUAL Mode: This is a less-used mode.  It allows selecting
		a section of text and applying vim commands on the
		selection such as cut, copy.  Press 'v' to go
		to visual mode.  Press 'Esc' key to go back to
		normal mode.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		When in visual mode, you will see the word "VISUAL" near the bottom
		of the editor window, as below.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">-- VISUAL --</pre>
	      <p>
		REPLACE Mode:  This is also a less-used mode.  It allows you
		to replace current text in the file with anythin you type.
		Press 'R' (Shift + r) to enter the REPLACE mode. Press 'Esc'
		key to go back to normal mode.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		When in replace mode, you will see the word "REPLACE" near the bottom
		of the editor window, as below.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">-- REPLACE --</pre>
	      <h3>Typing Text and Saving</h3>
	      <p>
		To start typing text into the file, go to
		insert mode by pressing 'i'.  You should be
		able to see "-- INSERT --" near the bottom
		of the vim screen.  Everything you type now
		will be visible in the window.  To correct
		an already typed word, you can use backspace
		to delete and retype it correctly.  You can
		use arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home,
		End to navigate the file.  To save your
		changes, type :w in normal mode.  
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Below is a message you might see if you save a
		new file "helloworld.txt".  The message says
		that this file is a "New" file with 1 line
		(1L) containing 15 characters (15C) in it.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">"helloworld.txt" [New] 1L, 15C written</pre>
	      <p>
		Go back to normal mode by pressing 'Esc' key
		once you are done typing.
	      </p>
	      <h3>Cut, Copy, Paste</h3>
	      <p>
		All these commands are run in Normal mode.  Press 'Esc' key
		to go to Normal mode.

		occurences, q to quit substituting.

	      <pre class="code">$ vimtutor</pre>
	      <p>
		vimtutor provides a reasonably detailed overview

		getting more familiar with vim text editor
		and learning more vim commands.
