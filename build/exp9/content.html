	<h3>What is an IP address?</h3>
	<p>
	  An IP address is a way to identify a network
	  device, e.g. a computer, on a network.  In order
	  to connect to a computer, you need to know
	  its IP address.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A computer can have multiple IP addresses e.g. one
	  for each interface it has.  An interface can be
	  wired or wireless.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<h3>How to find this machine's IP address?</h3>
	<p>
	  Running the command "/sbin/ifconfig" will display
	  the IP addresses of each interface on the
	  machine.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The example below shows that the machine has three
	  interfaces: eth0, lo and wlan0. (Note: the naming
	  of the interfaces varies with different linux
	  distributions, so you may see different interface
	  names on your machine.)
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  "eth0" is the wired interface (eth
	  stands for ethernet).  The machine's IP address
	  for this interface is 10.9.24.110.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  "lo" interface is a local interface
	  i.e. it cannot be used for communicating across
	  the network.  This interface is present on all
	  computers.  It's IP address is always 127.0.0.1.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  "wlan0" is the wireless interface.  It's IP
	  address is 10.9.24.231.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This machine can be contacted via either of the
	    two IP addresses 10.9.24.110 and 10.9.24.231.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How to check if this machine is connected to
	other machines, to the Internet?</h3>
	<p>
	  Run the "ping" command with an IP address you want
	  to test e.g. 10.9.24.1.  Press CTRL-C when you
	  want to stop pinging.  The ping command's response
	  below shows that out of 3 packets transmitted to
	  the remote machine, all 3 were acknowledged
	  (received) with none of the packets being lost and
	  it took a total of about 2 seconds.

	<h3>How to synchronize two files or directories on
	one machine to another machine</h3>
	<p>
	  Synchronizing two locations means having the same
	  content (files, directories) on both the
	  locations.  You can use "rsync" to synchronize files
	  and folders across different directories in the same
	  computer, or across different computers. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you want to synchronize two
	  directories with small content (a few kilobytes or
	  a few megabytes), you can just do an "scp" (as
	  explained above) and copy
	  the files from the source to target.  But if you
	  need to synchronize bigger directories (several
	  megabytes or even gigabytes), copy will not be
	  effective as scp copies all the content from
	  scratch and will take a lot of time.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  rsync only copyies the changes that were
	  done since last sync.  If both the locations
	  already have the same content, rsync will
	  not do anything.  rsync has the
	  additional benefit that it can retain the file
	  permissions and other attributes across the
	  locations. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Example 1: Synchronize contents of lectures
	  folder.  The below command syncs all the files
	  (but not subdirectories) in
	  /home/aditi/lectures directory with lectures
	  folder in Shyam's home directory.  Using the "-v"
	  (verbose) option, you can see the files being
	  synchronized. 
	</p>
	<pre class="code">rsync -v /home/aditi/lectures/ shyam@127.0.0.1:~/lectures/</pre>
	<p>
	  Example 2: Synchronize all C programs from present
	  working directory to /opt/cprograms/ directory,
	  retaining the last modified timestamps.  Using the
	  "-t" option enables synchronization of timestamps
	  as well (date and time when the file was last
	  modified).
	</p>
	<pre class="code">rsync -t *.c shyam@127.0.0.1:/opt/cprograms/</pre>
	<p>
	  Example 3: Synchronize all contents of "readings"
	  directory (including subdirectories) to "readings"
	  directory in Shyam's home directory.  Adding the
	  "-r" option synchronizes the directory recursively.
	</p>
	<pre class="code">rsync -vtr /home/aditi/readings shyam@127.0.0.1:~/readings</pre>
	<p>
	  Example 4: Synchronize all contents of Shyam's "music"
	  directory to the music directory in present
	  working directory.
	</p>
	<pre class="code">rsync -vtr shyam@127.0.0.1:~/music music</pre>
	<p>
	  Example 5: Synchronize all music from Shyam's
	  "music" directory to Ram's "music" directory.
	  Using the "-a" option triggers the "archive" mode
	  i.e. it synchronizes not only the content but also
	  permissions, attributes, timestamps, ownerships,
	  etc.  Using the "-z" option uses compression
	  during transmission, speeding up the transfer.
	</p>
	<pre class="code">rsync -az shyam@127.0.0.1:~/music ram@10.9.12.110:~/music</pre>

	  here, please refer to the manpage.
