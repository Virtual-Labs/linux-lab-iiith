* File management
** Theory 
*** Relative path or absolute path
    Explanation has to be improved. What is a file or a
    directory needs to be explained. What is / or root
    folder? There are no drives in Linux. / is used for
    separating parent and child entries. Unnecessary
    information about processes and links at this stage.
*** pwd
*** ls (-l, -a, -s, -R, -t, -h)
     + sRt options are not required
     + h requires understanding of units bytes, etc
     + Explaination of ls with directory as argument is not
       required
*** File permissions 
     + Not explained properly, best to indicate to ignore
       them
*** . and .. explaination needs to be improved
*** Suggested use of info 
     + Very bad idea. No explanation on how to navigate in
       info window or how to quit it
*** cat
     + Explaination is poor. Needs examples.
     + Explaining cat without explaining editor or echo
       with redirection is not advisable
*** cd (-, ~)
     + Explaination can be improved. 
     + Should include information on effect of using cd
       command without any argument
     + Should be explained right after pwd and before ls
*** touch
     + What if directory is touched?
*** mkdir
     + Explaination needs to be improved. What is a parameter?
*** cp (-r)
     + Explain what 'copy' actual means?
     + Explaination of recursive copying should be improved.
*** mv
     + Improve explaination
     + Explain overwriting of one file with other using mv
     + Difference between cp followed by rm of source and mv
*** rm (-r)
     + Move before mv command
     + Add warning and information that file/folder deleted
       cannot be recovered. 
     + Mention about absence of "Recycle bin" or "Trash"
       when using command line
     + Caution about deleting home folder
*** rmdir 
     + Move before rm command
*** -f, -i, -b options for cp, mv and rm
     + Not required and can be removed
** Experiment
*** Login and register are not working for some reason, hence cannot check the experiment.
