* Getting Help 

  This should not be first experiment. What man page is user
  supposed to look for when they do not know any single
  command? Man page wont make sense unless arguments,
  files, directories, pwd, ls, etc. are explained to some
  extent. 

** Theory 
*** man
    Show simple man page like of clear command and not of
    emacs
*** info
    Not required
*** whatis
    Not required
*** apropos
    Not required for beginners
*** Bash autocomplete 
    Not help
*** -h displays help for any command 
    *This is incorrect!!!* -h is used with ls for displaying
    size in human readable format
** Experiment 
   No Experiment ??
